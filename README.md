# Hello :wave:

</div>

This is the source code for my personal site. 

The site runs on [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and has its theme based on the [Nulite](https://github.com/codingpotions/nulite) project, which I used to generate the base for it.

I host it on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

This is a work in progress, and will definitely not be complete I think...ever? But I wanted to start, so here we go.
